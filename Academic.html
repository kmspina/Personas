        <p>The campus offers lots of resources that are more than just peer education too. TAs, tutors, and cornerstone help are all forms of help that are a step up from other students.

        <p>Professors at WashU are usually more than willing to help students understand and soak up the knowledge they need to. Office hours are a great way to get one on one time with a professor.  Go to <a href="https://wustl.edu/">WashU Homepage</a> and simply search your professors name to find their scheduled office hours.</p>
